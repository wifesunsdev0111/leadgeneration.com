				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How do you prioritize leads intelligently? Tracking the behavior of current prospects and their level of engagement can help determine their place in the buying cycle. Assigning points for various actions, lead scoring provides a data-driven approach to delivering the right message to each prospect at the right time.</p>
<p>Organization is essential in every element of business and sales are certainly no exception. One of the best ways to organize a path to increased sales is through lead scoring. By assigning a point scale to each lead based on our proven scoring system, your sales force can allot their time to only the most promising candidates. In addition to the priority or worth of a lead, lead scoring will also categorize leads by sales, partners, etc.</p>
<p>The key to lead scoring is data. Our team of experts collects information in two main areas:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strength of the Prospect’s Business </strong></li>
<li><strong>Strength of The Prospect’s Interest</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When both of these elements work in unison, we’ve discovered the perfect lead for your business. Lead scoring starts by looking at the history of the prospect’s business, the sustained growth of their company, the projected future of their industry and so much more. We will then look at their involvement with your website. If they are visiting daily or have taken the time to sign up for newsletters, white papers, etc. the lead score will be high and a conversion will be likely.</p>
<p>If a prospect just has a strong business, but doesn’t seem to have a huge interest – the sales score will be low, but the potential will be far from dead. Lead nurturing can target the larger prospects and have their lead score grow over time. Lead generation is a never ending process and with our proven lead scoring system, LeadGeneration.com guarantees your best potential at new sales.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>So many sales opportunities are lost due to ineffective follow up with leads who were engaged early in their buying cycle. It is crucial to stay in touch with prospects from beginning to end by presenting appropriate information and resources along the way based on where those leads are in the sales funnel.</strong></p>
<h2>What is Drip Marketing?</h2>
<p>Drip Marketing involves categorizing your base of leads by their perceived level of engagement and place in the sales funnel, and then targeting each with specific messages appropriate to where they are in the buying cycle. While email marketing is typically employed, other channels work as well such as Social Media and direct mail, depending on your audience.</p>
<p>The challenge is to make this automated series of contacts feel tailored to the individual recipient, which is no easy task. Your business may be targeting multiple segments and customer types like start-ups and enterprise, commercial and residential, and obviously the same message won’t work for all of them.</p>
<p>Your Drip Marketing campaign will also need to be sensitive to triggers alerting you to a change in the lead’s behavior, and then be capable of modifying the flow of messages to address this new stage in prospect development.<br />
Throughout the process your email messaging should be focused on keeping your brand in front of your leads, enticing them to engage with you, even before they are ready to commit to a purchase. And, once you’ve been successful in landing the sale, it’s wise to continue a Drip campaign to guide that customer through the initial set-up phase or some other instructional process, and then on to maintain a high level of customer service and generate up-sells via scheduled check-in email messages.</p>
<h2>What is Lead Nurturing?</h2>
<p>Lead Nurturing encompasses the overall brand awareness and educational aspects of your outreach well before customer is ready to make a purchase. Getting targets to subscribe to your newsletter is usually easier than getting them to take a sales appointment and you need to treat leads at the less-ready-to-buy stages much differently than those willing to hear a pitch.</p>
<p>Like with a Drip Marketing campaign, email correspondence is important here but should be supplemented with Social Media engagement and some well-timed telephone check-ins from your sales or support team, especially when there appears to be an uptick in activity related to email opens and click-throughs.<br />
The emphasis should continue to be on providing your leads with content that will educate them about your products and services, all the while explaining the core values of your brand. Lead Nurturing can be a long labor of love but the prospect that has consumed your materials and become a brand advocate before making the first purchase is much more likely to become a customer-for-life.</p>
<h2>And How Do They Relate to Lead Generation?</h2>
<p>Both Drip Marketing and Lead Nurturing work together to guide your leads through the sales funnel and require sophisticated approaches to content marketing, email automation, and telephone contact. Think of Drip Marketing as the vehicle that delivers the educational and brand-lifting content designed by the overall Lead Nurturing program. In addition to grooming your prospects wherever they are in the cycle, those same brand awareness content initiatives also lend themselves to the generation of new leads. And so the cycle continues…</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As much as we would like them to be, not everyone is ready to buy right now. To get the most out of a demand generation campaign, it is crucial to be conscious of where your prospect is in the sales cycle and stay engaged with the right message and process from beginning to end.</p>
<p>It’s important that marketers today recognize that potential buyers and clients get their information online through various sources, on their own timeframe. Because of this, marketers must focus on understanding each buyer’s individual needs and therefore fit into their decision process rather than pushing marketing messages toward them. Through demand generation, Leadgeneration.com can help create, nurture, and manage buying interest through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Campaign management</li>
<li>Lead management</li>
<li>Marketing analysis</li>
<li>Data management</li>
</ul>
<p>Key components of a demand generation process also include building awareness, positioning relevance, supporting validation and mitigating customer evaluation</p>
<p>By analyzing quality data based on a lead’s online behavior, marketers can begin to understand a buyer’s interest area and level, as well as the stage of their buying process. Once we have received this information, we are able to personalize our marketing campaigns around this data and therefore offer a deep level of personalization when it comes to targeting, timing, and content. Rather than pushing automated marketing messages toward them, we are able to customize our approach to meet their wants and needs to increase effectiveness.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to fuel sales pipelines and increase bottom line revenue, contact LeadGeneration.com today and learn more about demand generation.</p>
