				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wondering how to improve your B2B lead generation process? Things change quickly in digital marketing, and the way you brought in new customers yesterday may not work today. But with a little strategic retooling, you can revitalize both the way you find new customers and the way you keep them coming back.</p>
<p><a href="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/C-L-O-U-D.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-535" src="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/C-L-O-U-D-300x150.png" alt="B2B LEADS" width="300" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><strong>1. Embrace content marketing.</strong></p>
<p>If you haven’t jumped on the content marketing bandwagon yet, there’s no time like the present. Look into outsourcing if you don’t have an in-house editorial team – your accountant has been doing a great job, but she has other work to do. There are <a href="http://www.webimax.com/">agencies that specialize in content strategy and development</a> – work with one of them. They will bring a strategic perspective to your campaign that no entry-level freelancer can provide. Don’t throw away money on meaningless content that will ultimately damage your brand.</p>
<p><strong>2. Optimize for mobile.</strong></p>
<p>If you’re not fully engaged in the mobile game at this point – you need to be. Mobile devices now account for <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/21/majority-of-digital-media-consumption-now-takes-place-in-mobile-apps/">60% of time spent online</a> – which means that if you don’t have a fully responsive website, you’re losing out. Content and ad copy should also be tailored for the mobile platform – copy should be concise, and images should be scalable to read well on the small screen.</p>
<p><strong>3. Dig deeper on social media.</strong></p>
<p>If your social strategy is little more than just posting the same industry articles on every channel, it’s time to up your game. While Facebook and Twitter still dominate the social scene, there are more options for you to explore these days, and you want to tailor your posts to those different audiences. <a href="http://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/47445/~/long-form-posts-on-linkedin---overview">LinkedIn’s publishing platform</a> is a great tool, especially for B2B lead generation. Tumblr, Pinterest, YouTube and Instagram are all places you’ll find professionals hanging out now. Google+ is especially well-suited for anything tech-related. Understand your niche, and then deliver custom content to your best prospects where they are and in the language they prefer.</p>
<p><strong>4. Clean up your paid lead lists.</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t make it a habit to review your paid lead lists, you should be doing so at least every six months. If you buy lists, the company that provides them should be proactive about removing duplicates and nonexistent addresses before handoff – make sure they do. But more than that, you want to do a periodic check to see how your list is actually converting for you. Even if it was once converting well, lists can go cold. If you find that yours is no longer performing, consider your options. Maybe you want to try out another company, or maybe you need to change the parameters of your request because market conditions have shifted. The same strategy applies to those lead-gen directories you subscribe to – are they directing the same quality leads today that fed your sales team in the past?</p>
<p><strong>5. Seek out strategic partnerships.</strong></p>
<p>Strategic partnerships can be a strong source of leads, especially if you know how to pick a winning horse. Look for companies with products or services that complement your own – they likely have a similar need for strong partners who can help them grow their business. Say you design websites – you might want to team up with agency that specializes in social media or local search. You can recommend them for work that’s not in your wheelhouse, and vice versa. Beware partners who are benefitting from the relationship but not returning the favor. If you find yourself in this situation, look for ways to be more strategic about your partnerships.</p>

They can help you navigate the tools available and develop a custom program for your B2B lead generation process.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lead scoring is the process of categorizing leads by their perceived state of interest in a product or service. It is a critical part of lead management that allows sales managers and business owners to target the right leads or prospects with the right message at the right time and coax them through the sales funnel at the proper speed. Attaching value to each lead based on personal information and behavior allows you to separate high quality leads from casual browsers. The more time these quality leads spend with your content, the more likely they are to make a purchase or sign up for a service.</p>
<p><a href="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/TEXT-HERE.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-527" src="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/TEXT-HERE-300x150.png" alt="LEAD SCORING" width="270" height="135" /></a></p>
<p>Lead scoring takes time and patience. However, once you get it set up, the daily management requirements are minimal. The following details what you need to know to implement a lead scoring system that will be beneficial for your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Identifying specific characteristics that are necessary for a marketing qualified lead (MQL) enables you to assign point values to each qualification to create the core of your lead scoring system. The criteria fall into two distinct categories: fit (demographics, qualifications) and engagement (interests, level of activity). Fit helps you determine whether or not the individual is the right person to sell to while engagement level helps you determine whether or not the individual is ready to start talking to the sales team.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics.</strong> Demographics include age, gender, location, and other basic information, such as martial status and income, that is helpful for your team.</li>
<li><strong>Qualifications.</strong> Qualifications can include, but are not limited to, role / job title, size of the company or number of employees, and the type of company or industry.</li>
<li><strong>Types of interest.</strong> Content downloads are considered top of the sales funnel interests while product content (i.e. a free trial, pricing pages) is considered middle of the sales funnel interest.</li>
<li><strong>Activity.</strong> What are your leads doing on your site? Look at the number of web pages that they view and how many forms they complete. Pay attention to the amount of time that it takes a lead to engage with your site before converting into a customer.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Point values</strong></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve established your criteria, you can devise a points system with a specific value for each criterion. Most companies use a 0 to 100 scale, weighing the points in relation to readiness to talk to a sales rep. For example, maybe your ideal leads are executives in mid-range to large companies as opposed to lower staff members at small startups. As such, you would rate mid-range and large company executives higher than regular employees at smaller organizations. An individual lead score is the sum of that lead&#8217;s points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sales ready scores</strong></p>
<p>Lead scoring achieves two primary purposes. The first is to avoid irritating potential leads before they&#8217;re ready to buy. The second is to maximize sales team efficiency so that team members don&#8217;t waste time on leads who are not good candidates. Lead management software allows you to set up lead scoring criteria and then automatically score and re-score leads as their activity changes from day to day, but it does need to be managed by someone with expertise in this matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bottom line is that lead scoring is something that all B2B sales teams should be employing. Regardless of the size of your company and the products and services that you offer, lead scoring is proven to increase lead generation and ultimately, revenue.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is no secret that the process of lead generation has evolved. What was once an institution largely dominated by only telemarketing and e-mail blasts, it’s now been transformed into a process of relationship building and identity creation. Consumers’ eyes have grown weary of the massive amounts of generic advertisements and cookie-cutter e-mails they receive on a daily basis and are better poised to accept something that is unique, compelling, and personal to them. So how do we create this experience to generate more and better leads, you ask? Well, a great place to start is with some good old-fashioned inbound marketing.</p>
<p><a href="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/blogging-441005_1280.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-523" src="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/blogging-441005_1280-300x168.jpg" alt="blogging-441005_1280" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>Now, when using inbound marketing as a means for lead generation you are going to want to focus on a few things:</p>
<p>1. Content Creation: This process spans everything from informational blog posts to well-designed infographics, and even animated videos and webinars. The ultimate goal here is to create content that will attract, acquire, engage, and build trust with your target market.</p>
<p>2. Social Media: Once you have created some pieces of quality content, it is time to promote them via social media. Regardless of the industry, your audience is out there and using some social platform, or a host of them, so it makes for a great soapbox to get your brand’s voice heard. By sharing your unique content, you will naturally start to draw in consumers to view your website.</p>
<p>3. Website: Now that you have gathered interest and got fresh visitors to your site, you are in the home stretch. However, it is important to make sure your website is properly optimized to ensure you can gather these leads into your sales funnel. To do this, you want to have a dedicated landing page with forms to capture information (name, e-mail address, phone number) &#8211; but by all means keep it simple and easy!</p>
<p>4. Engagement: Then it’s time to follow up with the new contact. Is that person ready to talk business? Or is it too early to engage on that level? Either way, continual, personalized follow up is the way to stay in front of the lead, earn the lead’s attention, and ultimately land the sale.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leadgeneration.com/">Lead generation</a> is no longer about blanketing your target market with endless, faceless advertisements, but rather providing your audience with useful and personalized information. Master these elements and you’ll keep your sales team nice and busy – even if that’s just you!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a professional marketer (or business owner forced to wear the marketing hat), there are times when you wonder why the results you’re after are so elusive. You’re grinding out ceaseless effort but still falling short in terms of generating qualified leads and hitting sales targets. This is where you can benefit from a periodic review of your lead generation initiatives, making sure you don’t fall prey to a common affliction among desperate marketers: that when the current mix isn’t working, just do more of it!</p>
<p><a href="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Untitled-design2.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-506" src="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Untitled-design2-300x251.png" alt="lead generation" width="300" height="251" /></a></p>
<p>Let’s look a couple of common scenarios and see if any of them, or a combination of them, might be plaguing your lead generation efforts:</p>
<p><strong>The Old Favorite</strong></p>
<p>So, because you had your best year ever in 2009, you find yourself still chasing that record by continuing to employ that one and only service that worked for you back then. The only problem is that the online marketing environment has continued to evolve, more competitors are now chomping at your “low-hanging fruit” (we digital marketers just love that term don’t we), and you’re the only one pretending it’s still the last decade.</p>
<p>That favorite pay-to-play referral site just isn’t panning out like it used to, yet you find your spending has increased on it. Maybe the radio ads you religiously contribute to have waned in their reach and effectiveness. It could be that your target audience now hangs out somewhere else but you’ve somehow missed the memo.</p>
<p>Relying solely on “what worked back then” could be keeping you from “what works now”. There are many marketing channels that can drive qualified leads to your sales team and it’s worth the effort to run experiments with various methods.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media Stubbornness</strong></p>
<p>“Facebook Ads can’t possibly work for a B2B company like ours!” If you’ve uttered these words stop reading this article right now and <a href="http://leadgeneration.com/#form-anchor">go here for a professional and caring intervention</a> (you can finish the article later). Social Media advertising is constantly refining itself and improving its ability to target the customers you want. It’s very likely that unless it was within the last 2 to 3 months, your Facebook advertising experience is now irrelevant.</p>
<p>The same goes for other platforms. LinkedIn may have been a black hole for ad budget when you last used it 18 months ago, but things have indeed changed. You’ll chuckle now when we tell you how Instagram can be incredibly valuable for your lead gen efforts, but check back in a year and see if that sentiment hasn’t changed.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that none of these social lead strategies are fool-proof; they all require an intimate knowledge of the platforms, targeting, and best practices for ad design and management. The team at LeadGeneration.com is of course happy to assist you as you venture into this type of engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Your PPC Guy is Winging It</strong></p>
<p>If your results are dropping off, and your CPC’s are much higher than they used to be, it doesn’t necessarily mean that your in-house PPC person/staff is doing a bad job – it could be the result of a changing business landscape – but it’s worth investigating nonetheless.</p>
<p>This can also tie back to the first point about relying too heavily on the “old favorite”. Maybe the PPC campaign is performing optimally, but it’s no longer viable to put all eggs in that basket. It might be time to employ a strategic mix of services.</p>
<p>Any credible digital marketing firm that does Paid-Search will provide you an initial complementary analysis and by doing so can display their expertise in the field. It’s then that you’ll get some piece of mind about your current approach, or at least a clear understanding that it’s time to hire someone else.</p>
<p><strong> Does any of this sound familiar?</strong></p>
<p>To optimize your marketing efforts, be sure to <a href="http://leadgeneration.com/our-solutions/multi-channel-solutions/">incorporate multi-channel solutions</a>. With SEO, paid search marketing, social media marketing and content distribution, there are many methods that can significantly boost your qualified leads. There’s no reason to stick with a losing option.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/microsite-blog.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-309" title="microsite blog" src="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/microsite-blog.png" alt="" width="296" height="231" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As the depth and size of the Internet has grown, so too has the savvy by which potential customers search for the specific services they require. Years ago, people would go to Google and type in a very generic term such as “mortgages” and Google would return their search results. As time has passed, consumers demand more of their search results and type in more specific keyword phrases such as “Lowest Mortgage Rates in NJ”. This more specific search enables Google to provide a much more targeted return and one that a user feels will provide them with exactly what they need.</p>
<p>With that said the ability to have your company’s main website rank well for what could potentially be hundreds of targeted keywords is unlikely, but the notion of creating a network of optimized, specific microsites provides marketers with the chance to collect very specific opportunities.</p>
<p>Take for example the previously mentioned “Lowest Mortgage Rates in NJ” keyword search. Should you be able to acquire a domain related to that search like “LowestMortgageRatesNJ.com” and build relevant, unique content around that microsite, you have a great opportunity for a strong return on your investment. Just remember to keep it very focused on the narrow scope of keywords that this microsite would have the opportunity to rank well for.</p>
<p>The microsite process works exceedingly well for companies that have several product lines, as their customers may be searching for one specific area. The example I always like to use is Walmart. The store carries lots of products and a large number of people love going to Walmart to do all of their shopping in one convenient location. However, plenty of other consumers choose to go to specialty stores to find each genre of the products they need. This is no different on the Internet.</p>
<p>While some people may continue to focus on broad based, generic keyword searches, others are doing more drilled down, ultra specific searches. These very targeted searches convert at an excellent rate and are often some of the best lead opportunities your business will find.</p>
<p>While you always want to place focus on your core website, the integration of product/service specific microsites enables you to place targeted marketing efforts on specific offerings. The traffic headed to these sites should provide a nice boost to your bottom line.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before we begin, I&#8217;d like to give a definition of interlinking.</p>
<p>In general, interlinking is the act of connecting pages of the same website together using hyperlinks.</p>
<p>Hyperlinks can be found in many areas of a website – the breadcrumb area, footer, navigation bar, etc. – but, for the purpose of this article, we&#8217;ll be talking about hyperlinks in areas of the page where unique content is located. In other words, we&#8217;ll be talking about hyperlinks in the body text and how interlinking can help you create a smooth conversion funnel and rise in search engine rankings.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about the two parties we want to serve, starting with the most important.</p>
<h2>Who You Want to Serve with Interlinking</h2>
<h3>The People (Your Leads)</h3>
<p>At the end of the day, people buy your products and services – search engines don&#8217;t. Which is why it&#8217;s so important to make your website&#8217;s visitors your number one priority.</p>
<p>To do this, write the copy for your service or product page with only your customer in mind. Leave search engine ranking factors out of it. Forget about keywords, forget about interlinking, and forget about H1, H2, and H3 tags.</p>
<p>As you write more and see what your prospects and search engines respond to, you&#8217;ll become better at serving people and Googlebots at the same time.</p>
<h3>The Googlebot (What Decides Your Ranking)</h3>
<p>The Googlebot is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_spider" target="_blank">web crawler</a> responsible for deciding how and where your site&#8217;s pages appear in SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages). Even if you aren&#8217;t concerned about rankings (which would be very surprising), you need to be concerned with the Googlebot if you want to be found at all in SERPs.</p>
<p>In order to have new pages show up in SERPs, you need hyperlinks on indexed pages to link to newer pages. Essentially, the Googlebot follows the hyperlinks on older pages to find newer ones.</p>
<p>Say you create a sales page for a new product and publish it. The sales page shares the same root domain (www.rootdomain.com) as the other pages on your website, but, other than that, is its own entity. In order for the Googlebot to find the page and, in turn, have people find the page, you might put a link on your standard product/service page.</p>
<p>For instance, if we created a sales page for <a href="http://www.leadgeneration.com/lead-generation-solutions/lead-acquisition-enhancement/" target="_blank">our lead acquisition enhancement service page</a>, we would link to the sales page from the service page.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/lead-acquisition-enhancement.png" alt="lead-acquisition-enhancement" /></p>
<p>Inserting the simple &#8220;[Learn More Today]&#8221; link would allow the Googlebot to find the sales page, given that our Lead Acquisition Enhancement page is already indexed by Google. And after the Googlebot finds it, anything could happen.</p>
<p>The sales page could rise instantly to the top of SERPs (unlikely, but it&#8217;s happened before), or it could just be indexed. And we&#8217;d gladly take the latter, because we can change the ranking of an indexed page. We cannot, however, change the ranking of a non-indexed page because, as far as Google is concerned, a non-indexed page does not exist.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that when a page goes unseen by Google, it goes unseen by the millions of people who use search engines to locate services online every day.</p>
<h2>Conversion Funnel Optimization = Search Engine Optimization</h2>
<p>This is a prime example of how putting people ahead of rankings can actually help rankings.</p>
<p>When you improve the conversion funnel of your website with effective interlinking, you improve your chances of gaining leads. You also improve your chances of having more of your pages rank highly in SERPs.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s focus on guiding visitors down the conversion funnel and gaining leads.</p>
<h3>Interlinking for Leads</h3>
<p>One thing you need before interlinking the body text of pages is valuable information. This all goes back to writing for people instead of search engines. Instead of stuffing keywords into a page&#8217;s body copy and breaking your readers&#8217; interest, focus on the audience. Empathize with your reader and write what you would want to read. You can worry about optimizing the copy after it&#8217;s complete.</p>
<p>After your pages are filled with awesome, conversion-worthy copy, you&#8217;re ready to start interlinking.</p>
<p><strong>When interlinking for leads, keep this in mind:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Link from the top down</strong> (see chart below).</li>
<li><strong>Make anchor text engaging</strong>. For instance, if we were linking from the aforementioned Lead Acquisition Enhancement page down to the hypothetical sales page, we could make the anchor text more engaging than &#8220;[Learn More Today].&#8221; Instead, we could hyperlink some engaging text in one of the page&#8217;s sentences, like this one: &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">many of our clients see 10 to 15 times as many conversions</span>.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Use CTA buttons, too</strong>. Interlinking in body copy doesn&#8217;t have to be done solely with text. It can also be done with call-to-action buttons. If we decided to stick with the &#8220;Learn More Today&#8221; text and use it as a means to link to the sales page, we could turn that text into a button. Like this one &#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p class="center"><img src="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/learn-more-today-button.png" alt="learn more today" /></p>
<p>A linking hierarchy that would serve as a valuable way to generate leads AND rankings would look something like the chart below.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/linking-hierarchy.png" alt="linking-hierarchy" width="590" height="369" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.leadgeneration.com/" target="_blank">Homepage</a> -&gt; <a href="http://www.leadgeneration.com/lead-generation-solutions/" target="_blank">Lead Generation Solutions</a> -&gt; <a href="http://www.leadgeneration.com/lead-generation-solutions/lead-acquisition-enhancement/" target="_blank">Lead Acquisition Enhancement</a> -&gt; Sales Page</p>
<h3>Interlinking for SEO</h3>
<p>The chart above represents <a href="http://moz.com/learn/seo/internal-link" target="_blank">the optimal structure for a website according to Moz</a>. Moz, a digital SEO software company, recognizes this linking hierarchy as pivotal for SEO. And as we mentioned above, it&#8217;s the same structure that generates the most leads when hyperlinks are placed effectively in body copy.</p>
<p>The reason this structure is the best for SEO purposes can be summarized by Moz&#8217;s Googlebot graphic (keep in mind that the Googlebot is also referred to as a web crawler or spider).</p>
<p class="center"><img src="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/google-bot-comic.gif" alt="google-bot-comic" width="309" height="342" /></p>
<p><strong>According to Moz:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>In the example above, Google&#8217;s colorful spider has reached page &#8220;A&#8221; and sees internal links to pages &#8220;B&#8221; and &#8220;E.&#8221; However important pages C and D might be to the site, the spider has no way to reach them—or even know they exist—because no direct, crawlable links point to those pages. As far as Google is concerned, these pages basically don’t exist–great content, good keyword targeting, and smart marketing don&#8217;t make any difference at all if the spiders can&#8217;t reach those pages in the first place.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>When interlinking for SEO, keep this in mind:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Let keyword-rich anchor text come naturally</strong>. Google is always releasing new updates that penalize spammy websites, and one of the biggest indicators of a spammy website is its association with anchor text that&#8217;s solely keyword-based. For instance, if all the links pointing to our Lead Acquisition Enhancement page read &#8220;lead acquisition enhancement,&#8221; Google might penalize your site. While it&#8217;s okay to occasionally link down using anchor text that only contains the keyword, you should try to diversify the anchor text in hyperlinks pointing to each of your website&#8217;s pages.</li>
<li><strong>Add title tags to hyperlinks</strong>. This gives you the ability to discreetly add keywords in an ethical and useful fashion. The title tag contains the text that appears above the hyperlink when it is hovered over by your website&#8217;s visitors. The title tag is also read by search engines. For instance, the title tag attached to our aforementioned &#8220;[Learn More Today]&#8221; link might read &#8220;Learn how you can get up to 15 times more conversions with our lead generation services.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Link to sub-pages</strong>. This relates to the &#8220;optimal structure&#8221; we were talking about. Try to link to 1 or 2 relevant pages that are further down the chain. This will help web crawlers and people find your awesome service/product pages.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you spent a lot of resources creating a landing page and writing a killer piece of content for lead generation purposes, but are you getting the most mileage out of it? Whether it’s a whitepaper, an eBook, or a webinar, there are dozens of ways to take that content piece and repurpose it for maximum effectiveness.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/lead-gen-keyboard.png" alt="Lead Generation Keyboard" /></p>
<p>You already invested the time to create the cornerstone piece, so the repurposing process is the easy part. Here are some ways to get the biggest bang for your marketing buck:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create a Slideshare presentation. </strong>Pull the copy from the whitepaper, eBook, or webinar and put it into a PowerPoint presentation. Upload the presentation to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/" target="_blank">Slideshare</a> then share it on your social media channels.</li>
<li><strong>Create a blog series. </strong>Use the copy from the original piece of content to create a blog series. If you dissect the content into categories and write more detailed descriptions in your blog posts, you can keep people coming back for more. Again, make sure you share these blog posts through your social platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Create a Pinterest board.</strong> Create images that visually represent the different categories of your cornerstone content piece. Share these images on Pinterest and make sure you add links to your Slideshare presentation and the blog series you’ve created.</li>
<li><strong>Create a checklist.</strong> Most cornerstone pieces of content are instructional or explaining how to do something well. Turn the content into a checklist that people can use as a reference guide. Why not take this one step further and make it a downloadable document that requires contact information? There you go – another source of leads.</li>
<li><strong>Create an infographic.</strong> Infographics are great because they are easy to digest and highly &#8220;sharable&#8221; through social media. Create an infographic that explains your content piece in the simplest way. Don’t forget to add the infographic to Pinterest and other social channels for maximum reach.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you aren&#8217;t using Facebook as a tool for growing your client base then you&#8217;re missing an opportunity to turn prospects into customers. There are several ways businesses can <a href="http://www.webimax.com/internet-marketing-services/social-media" target="_blank">use social media to generate leads</a>, but today let&#8217;s focus specifically on Facebook. Here are the top three ways to use Facebook&#8217;s advertising platform as a leads generator.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Add a tab</strong>. Creating a “contact us” form on your Facebook Business Page, for example, is one way to turn visits to your Business Page into potential customers. Each tab has its own URL, so using this link with a strong call-to-action in your posts can drive people to the tab for maximum exposure. There are free tools, such as <a href="http://www.pagemodo.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pagemodo</a>, that provide free templates like the one below. Or, if you have the in-house resources or you work with an online marketing agency with web design &amp; development and social media services, you can create a custom tab that is specific to your needs and consistent with your website.</li>
</ol>
<div class="center"><img src="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/pagemodo-tab-creation.png" alt="pagemodo tab creation" /></div>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create unique content that links to a landing page</strong>. By creating content such as whitepapers, webinars, and checklists that are useful to your audience, they are serving double duty. Not only are you establishing your brand as a thought leader in your industry, but you are also developing opportunities to generate leads.</li>
</ol>
<p>✓ First, you&#8217;ll need to create a landing page where visitors are asked to fill out a form in order to access the content.</p>
<p>✓ Next, create a valuable piece of content that is unique and useful to your target audience.</p>
<p>✓ Then write social media posts that promote the content and link to your landing page. The posts should describe the value the content provides and include a strong call-to-action. Take this one step further and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/www/547448218658012?rdrhc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">boost these posts</a> using Facebook Promoted Posts for maximum exposure – and ultimately, more leads.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create Facebook ads optimized for conversions</strong>. While we&#8217;re on the topic of landing pages, go the extra mile and set up a Facebook ad optimized for conversions.</li>
</ol>
<div class="center"><img src="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/conversion-tracking.png" alt="conversion tracking" /></div>
<p>By placing a conversion-tracking pixel on your website, you will be able to see how many people clicked on your ad and became a lead. In the Facebook Ads Manager, you can view number of conversions and the cost per conversion. Here are the steps for creating an effective “Website Conversions” ad:</p>
<p>✓ Create up to six custom images that will be rotated and Facebook will test them then deliver the one that performs best (600 x 315 px)</p>
<p>✓ Choose a relevant “Call to Action Button” from the options below that people will see when they view your ad:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shop Now</li>
<li>Book Now</li>
<li>Learn More</li>
<li>Sign Up</li>
<li>Download</li>
</ul>
<p>✓ Write an engaging headline &amp; description (25 &amp; 90 characters, respectively)</p>
<p>✓ Choose your audience</p>
<p>✓ Set campaign schedule &amp; budget</p>
<p>For the best results, try all three of these methods for generating leads for your business. If you need help creating tabs, setting up landing pages, or determining your creative &amp; copy for Facebook ads, rely on expert online marketers and <a href="http://www.webimax.com/contact-us" target="_blank">contact</a> WebiMax today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-236" style="margin-left: 60px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Image1.jpg" alt="" width="578" height="257" /><br />
Think for a moment how you come by most of your information on a daily basis; whether it is a news story, an article, a discovery or information regarding family and friends, it is safe to say that one often hears about it through some sort of online medium.  Social media has really changed the way our world operates, and will continue to do so for some time.  Various online sources such as a company&#8217;s Facebook page, LinkedIn page and interaction through social media has connected individuals like never before.</p>
<p>As a business, the product or service you sell could be top-notch, groundbreaking or simply what a client or customer needs; but if they do not even know it exists, how can they take advantage of it?  Drumming up business or sales leads has changed.  In some ways it is easier than ever to get in contact with the right person.  Let&#8217;s review some quick tips on getting the most out of social media marketing and generating the leads and business that you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Facts</strong></p>
<p>Do you actually believe that social media sites have on leads and conversions?  Or are you still set in the old ways of thinking?  Let&#8217;s look at a few facts here: 77% of Business to Consumer marketers have acquired a customer through Facebook.  Facebook leads all social media outlets at 26% in terms of referring traffic to websites.  Think about the time and energy spent in the traditional ways of gathering leads: cold-calls, face to face meetings, traveling to meet with a potential lead and so forth.  Social media is here to stay.  Let&#8217;s look at some more hard data.</p>
<ul>
<li>LinkedIn is 277% more effective at generating leads than Facebook</li>
<li>77% of Business to Business marketers state that they have acquired a customer via LinkedIn</li>
<li>84% of marketing companies overall are utilizing some form of social media</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s fairly clear that social media has an enormous impact on producing leads and creating conversions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Defining the Effectiveness of Social Media</strong></p>
<p>If your business hasn&#8217;t taken advantage of the tremendous possibilities of gaining business leads via social media marketing, don&#8217;t wait another second.  The biggest impact on generating sales and business leads has come from SEO and social media.</p>
<ul>
<li>SEO -&gt; 59%</li>
<li>Social Media &#8211; &gt; 21%</li>
<li>PPC &#8211; &gt; 20%</li>
</ul>
<p>The conversion rates are nearly double when using SEO as opposed to PPC.  Businesses and consumer are responding in an extraordinary way when a particular company utilizes SEO; 77% of buyers say they would purchase from a company that utilizes social media and SEO.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it comes down to how well you are connecting with your potential customer.  The data is there: social media outperforms PPC and is a roadmap for getting new business leads.  Making efforts via Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and other sites can ultimately lead your business to a better future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-215" title="SEO" src="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Image3.jpg" alt="" width="284" height="284" /></p>
<p>Search engine optimization, in simple terms, is an Internet marketing strategy that strives to improve rankings and visibility for a website. An effective campaign should focus on getting the site ranked highly for keywords that are highly relevant and heavily searched. Sites that achieve these rankings can massively increase traffic from potential customers and creates the opportunity to increase leads and sales.</p>
<p>Search engines like Google, strive to present users with the most relevant results to provide their value. They create complex algorithms that are constantly evolving to determine what websites are best for any keywords you can imagine. Given the tremendous benefits businesses can gain from having their websites appear highly on a popular search engine, there is also great competition to hold these positions. A good strategy also factors the level of competition for the keywords targeted, so that rankings can be achieved in as little time as possible.</p>
<p>While there are general guidelines Google recommends for how it values sites, there is no definitive road map on how to achieve certain rankings. Also, rankings are constantly changing as algorithms are enhanced and data is updated. Further, results are far from instantaneous, efforts made today may not make an impact for weeks or months and steady consistent effort is required to win this type of race. As a result, many companies struggle to leverage SEO successfully as a lead source.</p>
<p>LeadGeneration.com and WebiMax have been highly successful at helping our clients gain top rankings in organic search results despite these challenges. Our expert team supports hundreds of clients and uses comprehensive approach to get the best results including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content development &amp; promotion</li>
<li>Quality link building</li>
<li>Technical modifications to sites that Google values</li>
<li>Social Media</li>
</ul>
<p>We also realize that just getting the traffic to your site isn&#8217;t enough. Our team also focuses on the landing pages your visitors are seeing to help get the highest conversion rate of visitors to become leads.</p>
