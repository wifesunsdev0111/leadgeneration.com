				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How do you prioritize leads intelligently? Tracking the behavior of current prospects and their level of engagement can help determine their place in the buying cycle. Assigning points for various actions, lead scoring provides a data-driven approach to delivering the right message to each prospect at the right time.</p>
<p>Organization is essential in every element of business and sales are certainly no exception. One of the best ways to organize a path to increased sales is through lead scoring. By assigning a point scale to each lead based on our proven scoring system, your sales force can allot their time to only the most promising candidates. In addition to the priority or worth of a lead, lead scoring will also categorize leads by sales, partners, etc.</p>
<p>The key to lead scoring is data. Our team of experts collects information in two main areas:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strength of the Prospect’s Business </strong></li>
<li><strong>Strength of The Prospect’s Interest</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When both of these elements work in unison, we’ve discovered the perfect lead for your business. Lead scoring starts by looking at the history of the prospect’s business, the sustained growth of their company, the projected future of their industry and so much more. We will then look at their involvement with your website. If they are visiting daily or have taken the time to sign up for newsletters, white papers, etc. the lead score will be high and a conversion will be likely.</p>
<p>If a prospect just has a strong business, but doesn’t seem to have a huge interest – the sales score will be low, but the potential will be far from dead. Lead nurturing can target the larger prospects and have their lead score grow over time. Lead generation is a never ending process and with our proven lead scoring system, LeadGeneration.com guarantees your best potential at new sales.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>So many sales opportunities are lost due to ineffective follow up with leads who were engaged early in their buying cycle. It is crucial to stay in touch with prospects from beginning to end by presenting appropriate information and resources along the way based on where those leads are in the sales funnel.</strong></p>
<h2>What is Drip Marketing?</h2>
<p>Drip Marketing involves categorizing your base of leads by their perceived level of engagement and place in the sales funnel, and then targeting each with specific messages appropriate to where they are in the buying cycle. While email marketing is typically employed, other channels work as well such as Social Media and direct mail, depending on your audience.</p>
<p>The challenge is to make this automated series of contacts feel tailored to the individual recipient, which is no easy task. Your business may be targeting multiple segments and customer types like start-ups and enterprise, commercial and residential, and obviously the same message won’t work for all of them.</p>
<p>Your Drip Marketing campaign will also need to be sensitive to triggers alerting you to a change in the lead’s behavior, and then be capable of modifying the flow of messages to address this new stage in prospect development.<br />
Throughout the process your email messaging should be focused on keeping your brand in front of your leads, enticing them to engage with you, even before they are ready to commit to a purchase. And, once you’ve been successful in landing the sale, it’s wise to continue a Drip campaign to guide that customer through the initial set-up phase or some other instructional process, and then on to maintain a high level of customer service and generate up-sells via scheduled check-in email messages.</p>
<h2>What is Lead Nurturing?</h2>
<p>Lead Nurturing encompasses the overall brand awareness and educational aspects of your outreach well before customer is ready to make a purchase. Getting targets to subscribe to your newsletter is usually easier than getting them to take a sales appointment and you need to treat leads at the less-ready-to-buy stages much differently than those willing to hear a pitch.</p>
<p>Like with a Drip Marketing campaign, email correspondence is important here but should be supplemented with Social Media engagement and some well-timed telephone check-ins from your sales or support team, especially when there appears to be an uptick in activity related to email opens and click-throughs.<br />
The emphasis should continue to be on providing your leads with content that will educate them about your products and services, all the while explaining the core values of your brand. Lead Nurturing can be a long labor of love but the prospect that has consumed your materials and become a brand advocate before making the first purchase is much more likely to become a customer-for-life.</p>
<h2>And How Do They Relate to Lead Generation?</h2>
<p>Both Drip Marketing and Lead Nurturing work together to guide your leads through the sales funnel and require sophisticated approaches to content marketing, email automation, and telephone contact. Think of Drip Marketing as the vehicle that delivers the educational and brand-lifting content designed by the overall Lead Nurturing program. In addition to grooming your prospects wherever they are in the cycle, those same brand awareness content initiatives also lend themselves to the generation of new leads. And so the cycle continues…</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As much as we would like them to be, not everyone is ready to buy right now. To get the most out of a demand generation campaign, it is crucial to be conscious of where your prospect is in the sales cycle and stay engaged with the right message and process from beginning to end.</p>
<p>It’s important that marketers today recognize that potential buyers and clients get their information online through various sources, on their own timeframe. Because of this, marketers must focus on understanding each buyer’s individual needs and therefore fit into their decision process rather than pushing marketing messages toward them. Through demand generation, Leadgeneration.com can help create, nurture, and manage buying interest through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Campaign management</li>
<li>Lead management</li>
<li>Marketing analysis</li>
<li>Data management</li>
</ul>
<p>Key components of a demand generation process also include building awareness, positioning relevance, supporting validation and mitigating customer evaluation</p>
<p>By analyzing quality data based on a lead’s online behavior, marketers can begin to understand a buyer’s interest area and level, as well as the stage of their buying process. Once we have received this information, we are able to personalize our marketing campaigns around this data and therefore offer a deep level of personalization when it comes to targeting, timing, and content. Rather than pushing automated marketing messages toward them, we are able to customize our approach to meet their wants and needs to increase effectiveness.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to fuel sales pipelines and increase bottom line revenue, contact LeadGeneration.com today and learn more about demand generation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wondering how to improve your B2B lead generation process? Things change quickly in digital marketing, and the way you brought in new customers yesterday may not work today. But with a little strategic retooling, you can revitalize both the way you find new customers and the way you keep them coming back.</p>
<p><a href="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/C-L-O-U-D.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-535" src="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/C-L-O-U-D-300x150.png" alt="B2B LEADS" width="300" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><strong>1. Embrace content marketing.</strong></p>
<p>If you haven’t jumped on the content marketing bandwagon yet, there’s no time like the present. Look into outsourcing if you don’t have an in-house editorial team – your accountant has been doing a great job, but she has other work to do. There are <a href="http://www.webimax.com/">agencies that specialize in content strategy and development</a> – work with one of them. They will bring a strategic perspective to your campaign that no entry-level freelancer can provide. Don’t throw away money on meaningless content that will ultimately damage your brand.</p>
<p><strong>2. Optimize for mobile.</strong></p>
<p>If you’re not fully engaged in the mobile game at this point – you need to be. Mobile devices now account for <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/21/majority-of-digital-media-consumption-now-takes-place-in-mobile-apps/">60% of time spent online</a> – which means that if you don’t have a fully responsive website, you’re losing out. Content and ad copy should also be tailored for the mobile platform – copy should be concise, and images should be scalable to read well on the small screen.</p>
<p><strong>3. Dig deeper on social media.</strong></p>
<p>If your social strategy is little more than just posting the same industry articles on every channel, it’s time to up your game. While Facebook and Twitter still dominate the social scene, there are more options for you to explore these days, and you want to tailor your posts to those different audiences. <a href="http://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/47445/~/long-form-posts-on-linkedin---overview">LinkedIn’s publishing platform</a> is a great tool, especially for B2B lead generation. Tumblr, Pinterest, YouTube and Instagram are all places you’ll find professionals hanging out now. Google+ is especially well-suited for anything tech-related. Understand your niche, and then deliver custom content to your best prospects where they are and in the language they prefer.</p>
<p><strong>4. Clean up your paid lead lists.</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t make it a habit to review your paid lead lists, you should be doing so at least every six months. If you buy lists, the company that provides them should be proactive about removing duplicates and nonexistent addresses before handoff – make sure they do. But more than that, you want to do a periodic check to see how your list is actually converting for you. Even if it was once converting well, lists can go cold. If you find that yours is no longer performing, consider your options. Maybe you want to try out another company, or maybe you need to change the parameters of your request because market conditions have shifted. The same strategy applies to those lead-gen directories you subscribe to – are they directing the same quality leads today that fed your sales team in the past?</p>
<p><strong>5. Seek out strategic partnerships.</strong></p>
<p>Strategic partnerships can be a strong source of leads, especially if you know how to pick a winning horse. Look for companies with products or services that complement your own – they likely have a similar need for strong partners who can help them grow their business. Say you design websites – you might want to team up with agency that specializes in social media or local search. You can recommend them for work that’s not in your wheelhouse, and vice versa. Beware partners who are benefitting from the relationship but not returning the favor. If you find yourself in this situation, look for ways to be more strategic about your partnerships.</p>
<p>If you’d like to explore even more ways to bring in more leads for your company, <a href="http://leadgeneration.com/">LeadGeneration.com</a> can provide you with a free consultation. They can help you navigate the tools available and develop a custom program for your B2B lead generation process.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lead scoring is the process of categorizing leads by their perceived state of interest in a product or service. It is a critical part of lead management that allows sales managers and business owners to target the right leads or prospects with the right message at the right time and coax them through the sales funnel at the proper speed. Attaching value to each lead based on personal information and behavior allows you to separate high quality leads from casual browsers. The more time these quality leads spend with your content, the more likely they are to make a purchase or sign up for a service.</p>
<p><a href="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/TEXT-HERE.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-527" src="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/TEXT-HERE-300x150.png" alt="LEAD SCORING" width="270" height="135" /></a></p>
<p>Lead scoring takes time and patience. However, once you get it set up, the daily management requirements are minimal. The following details what you need to know to implement a lead scoring system that will be beneficial for your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Identifying specific characteristics that are necessary for a marketing qualified lead (MQL) enables you to assign point values to each qualification to create the core of your lead scoring system. The criteria fall into two distinct categories: fit (demographics, qualifications) and engagement (interests, level of activity). Fit helps you determine whether or not the individual is the right person to sell to while engagement level helps you determine whether or not the individual is ready to start talking to the sales team.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics.</strong> Demographics include age, gender, location, and other basic information, such as martial status and income, that is helpful for your team.</li>
<li><strong>Qualifications.</strong> Qualifications can include, but are not limited to, role / job title, size of the company or number of employees, and the type of company or industry.</li>
<li><strong>Types of interest.</strong> Content downloads are considered top of the sales funnel interests while product content (i.e. a free trial, pricing pages) is considered middle of the sales funnel interest.</li>
<li><strong>Activity.</strong> What are your leads doing on your site? Look at the number of web pages that they view and how many forms they complete. Pay attention to the amount of time that it takes a lead to engage with your site before converting into a customer.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Point values</strong></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve established your criteria, you can devise a points system with a specific value for each criterion. Most companies use a 0 to 100 scale, weighing the points in relation to readiness to talk to a sales rep. For example, maybe your ideal leads are executives in mid-range to large companies as opposed to lower staff members at small startups. As such, you would rate mid-range and large company executives higher than regular employees at smaller organizations. An individual lead score is the sum of that lead&#8217;s points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sales ready scores</strong></p>
<p>Lead scoring achieves two primary purposes. The first is to avoid irritating potential leads before they&#8217;re ready to buy. The second is to maximize sales team efficiency so that team members don&#8217;t waste time on leads who are not good candidates. Lead management software allows you to set up lead scoring criteria and then automatically score and re-score leads as their activity changes from day to day, but it does need to be managed by someone with expertise in this matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bottom line is that lead scoring is something that all B2B sales teams should be employing. Regardless of the size of your company and the products and services that you offer, lead scoring is proven to increase lead generation and ultimately, revenue.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is no secret that the process of lead generation has evolved. What was once an institution largely dominated by only telemarketing and e-mail blasts, it’s now been transformed into a process of relationship building and identity creation. Consumers’ eyes have grown weary of the massive amounts of generic advertisements and cookie-cutter e-mails they receive on a daily basis and are better poised to accept something that is unique, compelling, and personal to them. So how do we create this experience to generate more and better leads, you ask? Well, a great place to start is with some good old-fashioned inbound marketing.</p>
<p><a href="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/blogging-441005_1280.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-523" src="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/blogging-441005_1280-300x168.jpg" alt="blogging-441005_1280" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>Now, when using inbound marketing as a means for lead generation you are going to want to focus on a few things:</p>
<p>1. Content Creation: This process spans everything from informational blog posts to well-designed infographics, and even animated videos and webinars. The ultimate goal here is to create content that will attract, acquire, engage, and build trust with your target market.</p>
<p>2. Social Media: Once you have created some pieces of quality content, it is time to promote them via social media. Regardless of the industry, your audience is out there and using some social platform, or a host of them, so it makes for a great soapbox to get your brand’s voice heard. By sharing your unique content, you will naturally start to draw in consumers to view your website.</p>
<p>3. Website: Now that you have gathered interest and got fresh visitors to your site, you are in the home stretch. However, it is important to make sure your website is properly optimized to ensure you can gather these leads into your sales funnel. To do this, you want to have a dedicated landing page with forms to capture information (name, e-mail address, phone number) &#8211; but by all means keep it simple and easy!</p>
<p>4. Engagement: Then it’s time to follow up with the new contact. Is that person ready to talk business? Or is it too early to engage on that level? Either way, continual, personalized follow up is the way to stay in front of the lead, earn the lead’s attention, and ultimately land the sale.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leadgeneration.com/">Lead generation</a> is no longer about blanketing your target market with endless, faceless advertisements, but rather providing your audience with useful and personalized information. Master these elements and you’ll keep your sales team nice and busy – even if that’s just you!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a professional marketer (or business owner forced to wear the marketing hat), there are times when you wonder why the results you’re after are so elusive. You’re grinding out ceaseless effort but still falling short in terms of generating qualified leads and hitting sales targets. This is where you can benefit from a periodic review of your lead generation initiatives, making sure you don’t fall prey to a common affliction among desperate marketers: that when the current mix isn’t working, just do more of it!</p>
<p><a href="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Untitled-design2.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-506" src="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Untitled-design2-300x251.png" alt="lead generation" width="300" height="251" /></a></p>
<p>Let’s look a couple of common scenarios and see if any of them, or a combination of them, might be plaguing your lead generation efforts:</p>
<p><strong>The Old Favorite</strong></p>
<p>So, because you had your best year ever in 2009, you find yourself still chasing that record by continuing to employ that one and only service that worked for you back then. The only problem is that the online marketing environment has continued to evolve, more competitors are now chomping at your “low-hanging fruit” (we digital marketers just love that term don’t we), and you’re the only one pretending it’s still the last decade.</p>
<p>That favorite pay-to-play referral site just isn’t panning out like it used to, yet you find your spending has increased on it. Maybe the radio ads you religiously contribute to have waned in their reach and effectiveness. It could be that your target audience now hangs out somewhere else but you’ve somehow missed the memo.</p>
<p>Relying solely on “what worked back then” could be keeping you from “what works now”. There are many marketing channels that can drive qualified leads to your sales team and it’s worth the effort to run experiments with various methods.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media Stubbornness</strong></p>
<p>“Facebook Ads can’t possibly work for a B2B company like ours!” If you’ve uttered these words stop reading this article right now and <a href="http://leadgeneration.com/#form-anchor">go here for a professional and caring intervention</a> (you can finish the article later). Social Media advertising is constantly refining itself and improving its ability to target the customers you want. It’s very likely that unless it was within the last 2 to 3 months, your Facebook advertising experience is now irrelevant.</p>
<p>The same goes for other platforms. LinkedIn may have been a black hole for ad budget when you last used it 18 months ago, but things have indeed changed. You’ll chuckle now when we tell you how Instagram can be incredibly valuable for your lead gen efforts, but check back in a year and see if that sentiment hasn’t changed.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that none of these social lead strategies are fool-proof; they all require an intimate knowledge of the platforms, targeting, and best practices for ad design and management. The team at LeadGeneration.com is of course happy to assist you as you venture into this type of engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Your PPC Guy is Winging It</strong></p>
<p>If your results are dropping off, and your CPC’s are much higher than they used to be, it doesn’t necessarily mean that your in-house PPC person/staff is doing a bad job – it could be the result of a changing business landscape – but it’s worth investigating nonetheless.</p>
<p>This can also tie back to the first point about relying too heavily on the “old favorite”. Maybe the PPC campaign is performing optimally, but it’s no longer viable to put all eggs in that basket. It might be time to employ a strategic mix of services.</p>
<p>Any credible digital marketing firm that does Paid-Search will provide you an initial complementary analysis and by doing so can display their expertise in the field. It’s then that you’ll get some piece of mind about your current approach, or at least a clear understanding that it’s time to hire someone else.</p>
<p><strong> Does any of this sound familiar?</strong></p>
<p>To optimize your marketing efforts, be sure to <a href="http://leadgeneration.com/our-solutions/multi-channel-solutions/">incorporate multi-channel solutions</a>. With SEO, paid search marketing, social media marketing and content distribution, there are many methods that can significantly boost your qualified leads. There’s no reason to stick with a losing option.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve heard this term before, and you know it has something to do with the hundreds of things required to create the ultimate online experience for your future customers. Inbound marketing is just the beginning, as it is merely a subset of a wider terrain of tools and strategies that guide the makeup of your sales funnel &#8211; the essence of all online revenue streams. Your job as a marketer is really to craft an online haven for followers in order to create true Demand Generation, a system that uses web content and lead engagement to move your prospects through a series of stages from awareness to conversion and then to repeat business.</p>
<p><a href="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Demand-Generation.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-497" src="http://leadgeneration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Demand-Generation.png" alt="Demad Generation = Leads" width="810" height="450" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Inbound Marketing Essentials</strong></p>
<p>In order to build your online field of dreams you must develop content and inbound marketing channels that allow people to check out your metaphorical ball park. Those channels are the avenues in which fans can gain entry to the game, such as pay-per-click ads, social media, email, and telemarketing. Referrals from satisfied customers also play into the process.<br />
The main thing to remember with email marketing is to give people reasons to open and read your content and stay engaged. By interacting with social media followers, influencers, and even your regular blog readers you actively take part in shaping purchase decisions.<br />
The object is to generate ongoing love from existing fans so that they&#8217;ll become even bigger fans and cheer louder for you in the stands, which can create waves of contagious referrals. But unlike classic stadium scenarios of faceless crowds, today&#8217;s inbound marketing requires that you develop a personalized relationship with each fan so that you can build a lifelong connection.</p>
<p><strong>The Connection between Content, Leads, and Sales</strong></p>
<p>Your web content is the treasure that attracts followers. By sharing important knowledge about not just your products, but your industry, you can gain the trust of people who cannot readily find this information elsewhere. One way to expand the value of, say, your White Paper research is by repurposing the content across various media, and then re-promoting with each incarnation coupled with links to relevant pages to create an archive of interconnected learning. As long as you&#8217;re not trying to outsmart the search engines and you truly are sharing real data and building stories out of the data, you will be creating more and more opportunities to engage your leads wherever they may be along the funnel.<br />
Each follower who interacts with you through social media, email and other forms of communication becomes a lead that you can generally score as hot, warm or cold. The purpose of lead scoring is so that you can make strategic decisions about how to engage each – should you work on converting them, or do they require more nurturing?  Each lead occupies a certain position in the sales funnel and you simply concentrate your efforts on treating them accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>But I just started Inbounding! There’s more?</strong></p>
<p>Inbound Marketing is a vital subset of Demand Generation, which covers the process from capturing to nurturing to converting leads and then repeating the cycle. But Inbound itself is not the whole shebang. The full process includes feeding knowledge to followers through campaign management, lead management, marketing analysis, and data management (yes if you’re doing it right your demand generation strategy is data driven!). Ultimately, your web assets should also lead prospects to your landing pages where they can make purchases. Demand Generation doesn’t leave off there – it also requires continued follow up with phone calls, in person visits, and solid ongoing customer service.<br />
The concepts all sound great, right?  But if you’re struggling to put it all together into a cohesive program <a href="http://www.leadgeneration.com/our-solutions/demand-generation/">consult with our marketing experts here</a> about how to enhance your lead nurturing process for better ROI.</p>
